# Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting  
## Comparative Modeling with Weather Impact Sensitivity Analysis

---

## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source files and supporting materials for a structured literature review and methodological framework on short-term electricity load forecasting (STLF).

The project critically examines traditional statistical methods, machine learning models, and deep learning architectures for electricity demand prediction. Beyond model comparison, this work emphasizes structured weather feature integration and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the marginal impact of environmental variables on forecasting performance.

Given the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and climate-driven variability in demand patterns, accurate and weather-aware forecasting is essential for reliable grid operation, economic dispatch, and energy management.
